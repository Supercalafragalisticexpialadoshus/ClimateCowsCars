				<p>The last subject that we will explore is war. This is a controversial subject because every nation
teaches a unique version of history designed to put them in the best light. I will do my best to offer you, dear
reader, thorough research on views which contrast with established historical beliefs. 
<a href="http://scorecard.goodguide.com/env-releases/cap/pollutant-desc.tcl" target="_mozilla">here.</a></p>

				<p>According to <a href="http://www.worldpeacediet.com/" target="_mozilla">Dr. Will Tuttle,</a> the entire origins of western
culture were rooted in the control and domination of animals. Historical documents such as the Old Testament and the epic of 
<a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gilgamesh/section1.rhtml" target="_mozilla">Gilgamesh</a> document the transition from
nomadic tribes to herding cultures. As humans became more attached to the control of animals, the relationship changed from one of 
honouring and worshipping life - to one of seeing animals as possessions and a form of currency. This culture became more 
powerful through domination of other humans and eventually came to conquer all nearby cultures in Europe and the Mediterranean. 
(<a href="http://www.sibyllineorder.org/reviews/rev_b_chalice.htm" target="_mozilla">link</a>)</p>

				<p>This greed for wealth caused an evolution toward the domination of land and eventually to domination of elements 
				consumed by humans (termed ‘resources’). The resource wars eventually came to encompass not just elements used for 
				sustenance but to precious metals and finally to fuel sources.</p>

				<p>Nearly everyone in the world clearly understands that the recent wars between the United States and Iraq were
fought in order to protect the oil supply (if you don’t see the connection, then 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/" target="_mozilla">this source<a></a> from the White House itself should provide credible evidence).
				</p> 
				
				<p>What is less well known is that for over a century, the most destructive wars that we’ve ever seen have been tied to 
				oil. At the turn of the 20th century, both Britain and Germany were converting their navy from 
				<a href="http://oilpro.com/post/4796/britain-vs-germany-coal-vs-oil--the-coming-of-the-great-war" target="_mozilla">coal to oil</a> 
				fuel. Both nations were vying for control of the Iraq oil fields as a rich source of fuel (sound familiar?). Britain through
the Anglo-Persian oil company (now BP) and Germany through the Berlin-Baghdad railway. It was this competition and the alliances linked to the power struggle which
helped set off the first ‘great war.’ 
(<a href="http://oilpro.com/post/4759/following-the-tracks-to-war-britain-germany--the-berlin-baghdad-railway" target="_mozilla">link</a>) 
In the years leading to the second World War, Hitler spent vast resources supporting Germany’s 
<a href="http://www.caer.uky.edu/energeia/PDF/vol12_5.pdf" target="_mozilla">artificial oil program</a> since the country had no 
natural oil fields (Britain had put a halt to Germany’s railway). It was only with the assurance of a reliable fuel source that 
Hitler felt confident enough to launch the first Blitzkrieg.</p>

				<p>Meanwhile Japan decided to attack Hawaii only after the U.S. imposed an 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Events_leading_to_the_attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" target="_mozilla">embargo</a> on
it’s oil supply. After the attack, Japan immediately moved to control Vietnam and the Indonesian oil fields. 
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvkT3ByU5yg&list=PL521AC800379852CC&index=4" target="_mozila">link</a>) 
After the World War 2 ended, the U.S. and Britain orchestrated an overthrow of the Iranian government in order to
prevent Iran’s Prime Minister from reducing western access to their oil supply.

				<p>In 1984 Iran once again took center stage when the Iran/Iraq war threatened oil shipments in the Persian Gulf. In order
to keep the 'black gold' flowing, the U.S. got involved in an embarrassing political situation.
(<a href="http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_tanker.html" target="_mozilla">link</a>)</p>
				
				<p>In the modern age, less powerful countries all over the world have suffered huge political upheavals due to 
				this almost ubiquitous addiction to fossil fuels. 
				(<a href="http://www1.american.edu/ted/projects/tedcross/xoilpr15.htm" target="_mozilla">link</a>). U.S.
forces fighting in Afghanistan have lost one person, killed or wounded, for every 24 fuel convoys it runs. Hundreds and hundreds of 
these convoys have been needed to truck fuel (for air-conditioners and diesel generators)
– to remote bases all over Afghanistan. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/opinion/19friedman.html" target="_mozilla">link</a>) 
Since the 1890s, the political leadership of the entire Middle East region has been dictated by Britain and later the United States
because of these countries’ reliance on oil for heating, industry, and transportation. <br>
With the emergence of new world powers, these conflicts are no longer merely a product of American-European resource grabs. <br>
The whole region of southeast Asia has recently been in an uproar near the Senkaku and Huangyan island
chains. The conflict of course was only sparked after the 
<a href="http://newsjunkiepost.com/2012/07/16/warsandconflictsovernaturalresources/" target="_mozilla">discovery of oil in the region.</a></p>

				<p>There is no question that battles over the really <b>essential</b> resources are being fought throughout the world. 
				(<a href="https://ninja.oximity.com/article/A-sea-of-people-fighting-for-water-in-1" target="_mozilla">link</a>) However 
				they often fall under the radar (no pun intended) because there aren’t expensive jet fighters and missiles involved. The 
				huge disparities around both water and food distribution favour the countries with enough money and fuel to
maintain military control. The enormous populations which are denied basic needs because of the resources given to animals 
inevitability causes even more world conflict.</p>
